### Lecture Title: Python File Input/Output (I/O)

#### 1. Introduction to File Handling
   - **Definition**: File I/O allows Python to read from and write to files stored on disk.
   - **Importance**: Essential for data persistence, logging, configuration, and many applications.

#### 2. File Modes
   - **Understanding File Modes**:
     - **'r'**: Read (default mode) - opens a file for reading.
     - **'w'**: Write - opens a file for writing (creates a new file or truncates an existing one).
     - **'a'**: Append - opens a file for appending (adds to the end of the file).
     - **'b'**: Binary mode - read/write in binary.
     - **'t'**: Text mode (default) - read/write in text (strings).
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     # Different file modes
     with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:  # Read mode
         content = f.read()
     ```

#### 3. Reading Files
   - **Reading Entire File**:
     - Using `read()` to read the full content of a file or `readline()` to read line by line.
   - **Reading into a List**:
     - `readlines()` to read all lines into a list.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
         content = file.read()  # Read entire file
         print(content)

     with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
         first_line = file.readline()  # Read first line
         print(first_line)

     with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
         lines = file.readlines()  # Read all lines into a list
         print(lines)
     ```

#### 4. Writing Files
   - **Writing to a File**:
     - Opening a file in write mode (`'w'`).
     - Using `write()` to write strings to a file.
     - Using `writelines()` to write a list of strings.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
         file.write("Hello, World!\n")  # Write a single line
         file.writelines(["Line 1\n", "Line 2\n", "Line 3\n"])  # Write multiple lines
     ```

   - **Appending to a File**:
     - Using append mode (`'a'`) to add content without overwriting the existing file.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     with open('output.txt', 'a') as file:
         file.write("Appending a new line.\n")
     ```

#### 5. Working with File Paths
   - **Absolute vs. Relative Paths**:
     - **Absolute Path**: Full path from the root of the file system (e.g., `/home/user/file.txt`).
     - **Relative Path**: Path relative to the current working directory (e.g., `file.txt`).
   - **Changing Directory**:
     - Using `os` module to change directories or get current working directory.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     import os

     print(os.getcwd())  # Get the current working directory
     os.chdir('/path/to/directory')  # Change current working directory
     ```

#### 6. Handling File Exceptions
   - **Using try/except**: Handling errors during file operations (e.g., FileNotFoundError).
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     try:
         with open('nonexistent_file.txt', 'r') as file:
             content = file.read()
     except FileNotFoundError:
         print("The file does not exist.")
     ```

#### 7. Context Managers
   - **Using `with` statement**: Ensures proper acquisition and release of resources.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
         content = file.read()
     # No need to explicitly close the file
     ```

#### 8. Binary File Handling
   - **Reading and Writing Binary Files**:
     - Use `'rb'` for reading and `'wb'` for writing binary files (e.g., images, audio).
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     with open('image.png', 'rb') as image_file:
         image_data = image_file.read()
     ```

#### 9. Conclusion
   - Summary of key points covered in the lecture.
   - Emphasize the importance of proper file handling practices for data integrity and program stability.

#### 10. Q&A Session
   - Open the floor for questions to clarify concepts and address any confusion.

### Additional Tips:
- Utilize code snippets and practical exercises throughout the lecture to reinforce learning.
- Encourage students to practice by creating, reading, and writing to their own files.
- Consider providing sample files for hands-on exercises related to reading and writing.
