### Lecture Title: Python Exceptions: Using Try and Except

#### 1. Introduction to Exceptions
- **Definition of Exceptions**: 
  - Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program, typically due to errors (e.g., invalid input, file not found).
- **Importance of Exception Handling**:
  - Preventing abrupt program termination.
  - Allowing graceful recovery from errors.
  - Improving code robustness.

#### 2. Types of Exceptions in Python
- **Built-in Exceptions**: Overview of common built-in exceptions.
  - `ZeroDivisionError` - Attempting to divide by zero.
  - `ValueError` - Invalid values given to functions or operations.
  - `TypeError` - An operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.
  - `FileNotFoundError` - Trying to open a file that doesn't exist.

#### 3. The try and except Blocks
- **Basic Syntax**:
  ```python
  try:
      # Code that may raise an exception
      risky_operation()
  except SomeExceptionType:
      # Code to handle the exception
      handle_exception()
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```python
  try:
      result = 10 / 0
  except ZeroDivisionError:
      print("You can't divide by zero!")
  ```

#### 4. Catching Multiple Exceptions
- **Handling Multiple Exceptions**:
  - You can define multiple except blocks to handle different exceptions.
  - Or use a tuple to catch multiple exceptions in a single block.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  try:
      value = int(input("Enter a number: "))
      result = 10 / value
  except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
      print(f"Error: {e}")
  ```

#### 5. Using the else Clause
- **The else Block**: Executed if the try block does not raise an exception.
- **Syntax**:
  ```python
  try:
      # Code that may raise an exception
  except SomeExceptionType:
      # Handle the exception
  else:
      # Code to execute if no exceptions occurred
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```python
  try:
      number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
      result = 10 / number
  except ZeroDivisionError:
      print("Cannot divide by zero.")
  else:
      print("Result is:", result)
  ```

#### 6. Finally Block 
- **The finally Clause**: Code in this block will run regardless of whether an exception occurred.
- **Usage**: Commonly used for cleanup actions (e.g., closing files or releasing resources).
- **Example**:
  ```python
  try:
      file = open("data.txt", "r")
      content = file.read()
  except FileNotFoundError:
      print("File not found.")
  finally:
      file.close()
      print("File closed.")
  ```

#### 7. Raising Exceptions
- **Using the raise Statement**: Manually trigger an exception.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Create custom exceptions for specific error handling needs.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  def check_age(age):
      if age < 0:
          raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative.")
      print(f"Your age is {age}.")

  try:
      check_age(-5)
  except ValueError as e:
      print(e)
  ```

#### 8. Best Practices for Exception Handling
- **Catch specific exceptions instead of a generic one** (`Exception`).
- **Keep the try block small**: Limit it to the code that might actually raise an exception.
- **Avoid using exceptions for control flow**: Use them for handling errors, not for routine control logic.
- **Log exceptions when necessary**: Helps in debugging and tracking issues.

#### 9. Conclusion
- Recap of the importance of exception handling in Python.
- Encourage practicing exception handling through exercises and use it in real-world applications.
- Open the floor for questions and discussions.

### Additional Resources
- **Documentation**: Python‚Äôs official documentation on exceptions.
- **Books**: Recommended readings for deeper understanding.
- **Interactive Exercises**: Online platforms for coding practice (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank).
