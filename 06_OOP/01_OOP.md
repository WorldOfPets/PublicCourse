### Lecture Title: Object-Oriented Programming in Python

#### 1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
   - **Definition of OOP**: A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods. üß©
   - **Key Principles of OOP**:
     - Encapsulation
     - Inheritance
     - Polymorphism
     - Abstraction

#### 2. Why Use OOP?
   - **Modularity**: Code is organized into reusable objects.
   - **Maintenance**: Easier to manage and update code.
   - **Reusability**: Classes can be reused across different programs.
   - **Real-world modeling**: More intuitive representation of real-world entities.

#### 3. Core Concepts of OOP

##### 3.1. Classes and Objects
   - **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects that define a set of attributes and methods. üöß
   - **Object**: An instance of a class that contains real values instead of variables.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     #CLASS
     class Car:
         def __init__(self, make, model, year):
             self.make = make
             self.model = model
             self.year = year
     #OBJECT
     my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
     ```
  
##### 3.2. Attributes and Methods
   - **Attributes**: Variables that hold data specific to an object.
   - **Methods**: Functions that define the behaviors of an object.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class Car:
         def __init__(self, make, model, year):
            #ATTRIBUTES
             self.make = make
             self.model = model
             self.year = year
         #METHODS (inner functions)
         def display_info(self):
             return f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"

     my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
     print(my_car.display_info())  # Output: 2020 Toyota Corolla
     ```

##### 3.3. Encapsulation
   - **Definition**: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods into a single unit or class.
   - **Access Modifiers**:
     - Public: Accessible from outside the class.
     - Protected: Intended for internal use within a class or subclass (prefix `_`).
     - Private: Not accessible outside the class (prefix `__`).
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class Person:
         def __init__(self, name, age):
             self.__name = name  # Private attribute
             self.__age = age

         def get_name(self):
             return self.__name

     p = Person("Alice", 30)
     print(p.get_name())  # Output: Alice
     ```

##### 3.4. Inheritance
   - **Definition**: A mechanism for creating a new class using the properties and methods of an existing class.
   - **Benefits**: Code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class Vehicle:
         def start_engine(self):
             print("Engine started")

     class Car(Vehicle):
         def open_trunk(self):
             print("Trunk opened")

     my_car = Car()
     my_car.start_engine()  # Inherited method
     my_car.open_trunk()    # Car's method
     ```

##### 3.5. Polymorphism
   - **Definition**: The ability to present the same interface for different underlying data types. 
   - **Method Overriding**: Redefining a method in a derived class that was already defined in the base class.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class Animal:
         def speak(self):
             raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement abstract method")

     class Dog(Animal):
         def speak(self):
             return "Woof!"

     class Cat(Animal):
         def speak(self):
             return "Meow!"

     def animal_sound(animal):
         print(animal.speak())

     dog = Dog()
     cat = Cat()
     animal_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof!
     animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow!
     ```

Sure! Here‚Äôs how you can replace the topic on abstraction with a focus on static methods in Python.

### 3.6. Static Methods
   - **Definition**: Static methods are methods that belong to a class rather than any specific instance of the class. They do not require a class instance and can be called on the class itself. They are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.
   - **Use Cases**: Useful for utility functions that are related to the class but do not require access to instance-specific data (properties).
   
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class MathUtils:
         def add(x, y):
             return x + y

         @staticmethod
         def multiply(x, y):
             return x * y
     
     product_result = MathUtils.multiply(5, 3)
     math_utils = MathUtils()
     sum_result = math_utils.add(5, 3)
     #sum_result = MathUtils.add(5, 3) #not work
     print(sum_result)      # Output: 8
     print(product_result)  # Output: 15
     ```

   - **Advantages of Static Methods**:
     - **Encapsulation**: They can encapsulate related methods that don‚Äôt need to access the instance or class-level data.
     - **Namespace Management**: Help organize utility functions within the scope of the class.

   - **Important to Note**: Static methods cannot access or modify class state or instance variables.

#### 4. Conclusion
   - Recap of key points: classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
   - Emphasis on the importance of OOP in Python and real-world applications.

#### 5. Q&A Session
   - Open the floor for questions to clarify concepts and address any confusion.

### Additional Tips for the Lecture:
- **Live Coding**: Demonstrate real-time coding examples for better understanding. üíª
- **Hands-On Exercises**: Provide exercises for students to create their own classes, use inheritance, and implement polymorphism.
- **Real-World Applications**: Discuss how OOP is used in frameworks (like Django or Flask) and libraries (like NumPy or Pandas).
