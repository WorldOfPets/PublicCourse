Here‚Äôs a set of independent tasks focused on the topics of Python variables, conditional statements, and loops. These tasks can help reinforce understanding and provide practical coding experience. üêçüìù

### Independent Tasks: Python Variables, Conditionals, and Loops

#### Task 1: Variables and Data Types
1. **Create Variables**:
   - Create a variable `name` and assign it your name (string).
   - Create a variable `age` and assign it your age (integer).
   - Create a variable `height` and assign it your height in meters (float).

2. **Print Variables**:
   - Write a print statement that outputs: ‚ÄúMy name is [name], I am [age] years old and my height is [height] meters.‚Äù

3. **Type Information**:
   - Print the type of each variable using the `type()` function.

#### Task 2: Conditional Statements
1. **Grade Calculator**:
   - Create a variable `score` and assign it a value between 0 and 100.
   - Write conditional statements to determine the letter grade based on the following scale:
     - A: 90-100
     - B: 80-89
     - C: 70-79
     - D: 60-69
     - F: below 60
   - Print the corresponding letter grade.

2. **Even or Odd**:
   - Create a variable `number` and assign it an integer.
   - Use an if-else statement to check if the number is even or odd. Print "Even" if it is even and "Odd" if it is odd.

#### Task 3: Loops
1. **Counting Down**:
   - Write a `for` loop that counts down from 10 to 1 and prints each number. `10, 9, 8, ..., 1`.
   - After the countdown, print "Blast off!".

2. **Sum of Numbers**:
   - Write a `while` loop that asks the user for a number. 
   - Keep asking until the user enters a negative number. 
   - Calculate and print the sum of all positive numbers entered.

3. **Multiples of 3**:
   - Write a `for` loop that prints all multiples of 3 from 1 to 30. 
   - Example output should look like: `3, 6, 9, 12, ..., 30`.

#### Task 4: Combining Concepts
1. **Number Classification**:
   - Create a program that asks the user to input a number.
   - Use a conditional statement to classify the number:
     - If the number is greater than 0, print "Positive".
     - If the number is less than 0, print "Negative".
     - If the number is 0, print "Zero".
   - Then use a loop to print all integers from that number to 10, if the input is less than 10; otherwise, print all integers from the input down to 0.

2. **Fibonacci Sequence**:
   - Write a `while` loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` (where `n` is a variable any positive integer defined by the user).
   - Use a conditional to check if `n` is positive; if it is not, print "Please enter a positive integer".
   - Print the Fibonacci numbers as they are generated.

### Bonus Task:
- **Simple Quiz**:
  - Create a multiple-choice quiz that asks the user 3 questions (you can use variables for questions, choices, and correct answers).
  - For each question, use a conditional statement to check if the user‚Äôs answer is correct and keep track of the score.
  - Print the total score at the end of the quiz.

### Instructions for Submission:
- Complete all tasks and run your code to ensure it works as expected.
- Write comments in your code explaining what each section does.
- Submit your code in a `.py` file or share it through an online code platform like GitHub or Replit.
