# Complete Guide to NumPy

## 1. Introduction to NumPy
- **What is NumPy?**
  - NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library in Python used for numerical computing. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- **Key Features:**
  - High-performance multidimensional arrays (ndarrays).
  - Mathematical functions for array operations.
  - Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code.
  - Linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.

## 2. Installing NumPy
To use NumPy, you need to install it first. This can be done using pip.

### Installation Steps:
- Open your command line interface (Terminal, Command Prompt).
- Run the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  ```

### Verification:
- To check if NumPy is installed correctly, open a Python shell (or Jupyter Notebook) and run:
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  print(np.__version__)
  ```

## 3. Getting Started with NumPy
### Importing NumPy
- The convention is to import NumPy as `np`:
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  ```

### Creating NumPy Arrays
1. **Creating Arrays from Lists:**
   ```python
   a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
   print(a)  # Output: [1 2 3]
   ```

2. **Creating Multi-dimensional Arrays:**
   ```python
   b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
   print(b)
   # Output:
   # [[1 2 3]
   #  [4 5 6]]
   ```

### Array Attributes
- **Shape:** The dimensions of the array.
- **Size:** Total number of elements.
- **Data Type:** The type of data held in the array.

```python
print(a.shape)  # Output: (3,)
print(b.shape)  # Output: (2, 3)
print(b.size)   # Output: 6
print(b.dtype)  # Output: int64 (or similar based on your environment)
```

## 4. Important NumPy Functions
### Array Creation Functions
- `np.zeros(shape)`: Creates an array filled with zeros.
- `np.ones(shape)`: Creates an array filled with ones.
- `np.arange(start, stop, step)`: Creates an array with a range of values.
- `np.linspace(start, stop, num)`: Creates an array with evenly spaced values.

### Examples
```python
zeros_array = np.zeros((2, 3))
ones_array = np.ones((3, 2))
range_array = np.arange(0, 10, 2)
linspace_array = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)

print(zeros_array)
print(ones_array)
print(range_array)
print(linspace_array)
```

### Array Manipulation
- **Indexing and Slicing:**
  ```python
  print(b[0, 1])  # Output: 2
  print(b[1, :])  # Output: [4 5 6]
  ```

- **Reshaping Arrays:**
  ```python
  c = np.arange(1, 10)
  d = c.reshape(3, 3)
  print(d)
  ```

- **Stacking and Concatenating Arrays:**
  ```python
  e = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
  f = np.array([[5, 6]])
  vstacked = np.vstack((e, f))  # Vertical stacking
  hstacked = np.hstack((e, f.T))  # Horizontal stacking
  print(vstacked)
  print(hstacked)
  ```

## 5. Basic Operations with NumPy Arrays
### Mathematical Operations
- **Element-wise Operations:**
  ```python
  x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
  y = np.array([4, 5, 6])
  print(x + y)  # Output: [5 7 9]
  print(x * y)  # Output: [4 10 18]
  ```

- **Universal Functions (ufuncs):**
  NumPy provides a set of mathematical functions that apply to each element in an array:
  - `np.sin()`, `np.cos()`, `np.exp()`, `np.log()`, etc.

### Statistical Operations
- `np.mean(array)`: Computes the mean.
- `np.median(array)`: Computes the median.
- `np.std(array)`: Computes the standard deviation.

### Examples
```python
data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(np.mean(data))       # Output: 3.0
print(np.median(data))     # Output: 3.0
print(np.std(data))        # Output: 1.41421356
```

## 6. Linear Algebra with NumPy
- **Matrix operations**:
  - Dot product: `np.dot(a, b)` or `a @ b`.
  - Transpose: `a.T`.
  - Determinant and inverse of matrices: `np.linalg.det()` and `np.linalg.inv()`.
  
### Example
```python
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

print(np.dot(A, B))  # Dot product
print(A.T)           # Transpose
print(np.linalg.inv(A))  # Inverse of A
```

## 7. Random Number Generation
NumPy includes a random module for generating random numbers, which is useful for simulations, testing, and data generation.
```python
# Randomly seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(0)

random_array = np.random.rand(3, 2)  # Array of random floats in [0.0, 1.0)
print(random_array)

int_randoms = np.random.randint(0, 10, (2, 3))  # Random integers between 0 and 10
print(int_randoms)
```

## 8. Conclusion
- **Recap Key Concepts**: Summary of array creation, manipulation, mathematical operations, and applications in data analysis.
- **Further Learning**: Explore companion libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for advanced data manipulation and visualization.

## 9. Additional Resources
- **Documentation**: [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
- **Books**:
  - "Python Data Science Handbook" by Jake VanderPlas.
  - "NumPy Cookbook" by Ivan Idris.
- **Online Courses**: Look for courses on platforms like Coursera, Udacity, or edX to expand learning.
