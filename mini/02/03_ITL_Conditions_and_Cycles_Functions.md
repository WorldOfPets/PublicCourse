Here are some independent tasks related to Python conditions, loops, and functions. These tasks aim to be both engaging and educational, giving you an opportunity to practice your skills. Have fun with them! ðŸ˜„

### Independent Tasks

#### Task 1: ATM Simulation

Build a simple ATM simulation program that allows a user to check their balance, deposit money, and withdraw money. The program should loop until the user chooses to exit.

**Requirements:**
- Use a variable to hold the balance.
- Implement options for checking the balance, depositing, withdrawing, and exiting the program.
- Use conditions to validate deposit and withdrawal amounts.

---

#### Task 2: Multiplication Table Generator

Create a program that generates a multiplication table for a number provided by the user. The table should go up to the number 10.

**Requirements:**
- Take an integer input from the user.
- Use a `for` loop to generate the multiplication table and print it in a user-friendly format.

---

#### Task 3: Prime Number Checker

Write a function that checks if a given number is a prime number. A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Requirements:**
- Use a loop to check for factors from 2 to the square root of the number.
- Return `True` if the number is prime; otherwise, return `False`.

---

#### Task 4: Generate Fibonacci Sequence

Create a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

**Requirements:**
- Accept an integer input from the user that specifies how many terms of the sequence to generate.
- Use a loop to build the sequence and print it.

---

#### Task 5: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Implement a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user plays against the computer.

**Requirements:**
- The user should be able to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer should randomly select its choice.
- Determine the winner using conditions.
- Allow the user to play multiple rounds until they decide to quit.

---

#### Task 6: Count Vowels in a String

Create a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string. 

**Requirements:**
- Accept a string input from the user.
- Use a loop to count vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) in both uppercase and lowercase.
- Return the count.

---

#### Task 7: Pythagorean Triplets

Design a program to find all Pythagorean triplets (a, b, c) such that \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \) for a given range.

**Requirements:**
- Allow the user to input the range limit.
- Use nested loops to find and print all integer triplets in that range.

---

#### Task 8: Grade Average Calculator

Write a program that allows a user to input several student grades and then calculates the average grade.

**Requirements:**
- Continuously prompt for grades until the user enters a sentinel value (e.g., -1).
- Use a function to calculate the average.
- Print the average grade at the end.

### Tips for Completing the Tasks

- Break down each task into smaller parts. Start by writing pseudocode if needed.
- Test your code with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.
- Use comments to document your thought process and the purpose of your code.
