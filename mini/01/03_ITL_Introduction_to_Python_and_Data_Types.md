Here are some independent tasks designed to reinforce your understanding of Python and its data types. Each task progressively builds on what you've learned about Python's syntax and its core data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets. Give them a try! ðŸš€

### Independent Tasks: Introduction to Python and Data Types

---

#### Task 1: Basic Python Syntax

1. **Print Your Name**:
   - Write a Python program that prints your name and age.
   
   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

2. **Basic Arithmetic**:
   - Create a program that performs the following operations:
     - Add two numbers
     - Subtract two numbers
     - Multiply two numbers
     - Divide two numbers

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

#### Task 2: Working with Lists

1. **Create a List**:
   - Create a list named `my_favorite_books` and add at least five book titles (as strings).

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

2. **List Operations**:
   - Print the first and last book in the list.
   - Append a new book title to the list and print the updated list.

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

3. **Slicing Lists**:
   - Create a list of your five favorite movies and print only the second and third movies.

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

#### Task 3: Working with Dictionaries

1. **Create a Dictionary**:
   - Create a dictionary called `person` with keys for `name`, `age`, `city`, and `favorite_color`.

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

2. **Dictionary Operations**:
   - Change the value of `favorite_color` to a new color.
   - Add a new key, `hobbies`, which contains a list of your hobbies.

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

3. **Print Key-Value Pairs**:
   - Iterate over the dictionary and print each key-value pair.

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

---

#### Task 4: Working with Tuples

1. **Create a Tuple**:
   - Create a tuple named `coordinates` that holds the latitude and longitude of a place (as floats).

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

2. **Access Tuple Elements**:
   - Print each element of the tuple separately.

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

3. **Count Elements**:
   - Create a tuple of your three favorite numbers and print the count of a specific number in that tuple.

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

---

#### Task 5: Working with Sets

1. **Create a Set**:
   - Create a set named `unique_colors` that includes at least five different color names (as strings).

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

2. **Set Operations**:
   - Add two new colors to the set and print the updated set.
   - Remove one color from the set and print the updated set.

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

3. **Check Existence**:
   - Check if a specific color is in the set and print the result.

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```

---

#### Task 6: Combine All Data Types

1. **Build a Personal Profile**:
   - Create a list of your hobbies, a dictionary with your personal details (name, age, hobbies), a tuple with your favorite numbers, and a set of your favorite colors.
   
2. **Display Information**:
   - Print a summary of your profile using all the data structures you created.

   ```python
   # Your Code Here
   ```
