### Independent Tasks on Python Data Structures and Loops

#### Task 1: Working with Lists
1. **Create a List**: Define a list of your five favorite fruits.
2. **List Operations**:
   - Add two more fruits to the list.
   - Remove one fruit by its name.
   - Sort the list alphabetically and print it.
3. **Loop Through the List**: Use a `for` loop to print each fruit in the list with a message, e.g., "I like apples!"

#### Task 2: Using Tuples
1. **Create a Tuple**: Create a tuple containing the numbers from 1 to 5.
2. **Accessing Elements**: Access and print the second and fourth elements of the tuple.
3. **Tuple Length**: Print the length of the tuple.

#### Task 3: Working with Dictionaries
1. **Create a Dictionary**: Create a dictionary to store information about a book (title, author, publication year, genre).
2. **Update the Dictionary**: Add a new key-value pair for the ISBN number.
3. **Loop Through the Dictionary**: Use a loop to print out each key-value pair in the format: "Title: [Title], Author: [Author], Year: [Year], Genre: [Genre]".

#### Task 4: Using Sets
1. **Create a Set**: Create a set of five unique colors.
2. **Add and Remove**:
   - Add another color to the set.
   - Remove one color from the set.
3. **Set Operations**: Create another set of three different colors, then calculate and print the union and intersection of the two sets.

#### Task 5: Nested Loops with Lists
1. **Create a Nested List**: Create a list of lists representing a 3x3 matrix (e.g., a list containing three lists that each contain three integers).
2. **Print the Matrix**: Use nested loops to print the matrix in a grid format.
3. **Sum of Elements**: Calculate and print the sum of all elements in the matrix.

#### Task 6: Iterating with `while` Loops
1. **Countdown**: Create a countdown function that takes a number as an argument and uses a `while` loop to print numbers from that number down to 1.
2. **User Input**: Modify the countdown function to continue until the user enters `0`, printing a message for each countdown.

#### Task 7: List Comprehensions
1. **Using List Comprehensions**: Create a list of squares for numbers from 1 to 10 using a list comprehension, and print the resulting list.
2. **Filter Even Numbers**: Use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the even numbers from a given list of integers.

#### Task 8: Practice Problem ‚Äì FizzBuzz
1. **FizzBuzz Challenge**:
   - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
   - For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
   - For multiples of 5, print "Buzz".
   - For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

### Bonus Task: Combine Data Structures and Loops
1. **Shopping List**:
   - Create an empty dictionary to represent a shopping list.
   - Use a loop to prompt the user to enter items and their quantities until they type "done".
   - Print out the final shopping list after the user is done entering items.

### Conclusion
Completing these tasks will give you hands-on experience with Python data structures and loops. Don't hesitate to explore variations on these tasks or combine multiple concepts in your solutions! If you need any hints or further clarification on tasks, feel free to ask. Happy coding! üéâ
